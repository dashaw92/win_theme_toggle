I wanted to be able to dynamically set the theme of my windows install based off a schedule.
There is software already out there to do this, but they're insanely bloated for what they do,
causing a noticeable lag whenever a rollover occurs. This runs instantly.

You can force the theme with either "dark" or "light" as arguments to the binary.
Running without arguments will load the config.toml (comes with a preset schedule)
and determine what theme should be picked based off the current time.
